# 👶 Baby Countdown

baby-countdown is a heartfelt React application built with Create React App and JSX, designed to count down the days until the arrival of a newborn baby. Originally created to celebrate the anticipation of my daughter’s birth, this app served as a personal milestone tracker and joyful reminder of the big day.

🍼 My daughter has already arrived — so this app is currently paused, but I plan to come back and repair or enhance it soon.
